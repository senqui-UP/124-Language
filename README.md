## Language Overview

The PyCraft Programming language is a Python-based language designed to mimic how command lines work in the game Minecraft. Its purpose is to serve as an experimental language and expand on how Minecraft commands already function. It serves as a gamified version of the Python language, encouraging those familiar with Minecraft to engage in programming and explore coding.
